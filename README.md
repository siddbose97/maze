I started using the Randomized Prim algorithm to create a maze in python.
Since a maze without a GUI isn't much fun I used TKinter and some guidance from AliMahmoud7 to create my interface and solver

My Final solution as shown below is a DFS implementation of a maze generator that can be initialized as a square of any size.
