Randomized Prim's Algorithm Logic

Base Version:
1. Start with a grid consisting only of walls
2. Pick a cell randomly, set the cell to "cell" and add "cell"s walls to the wall list
3. While the wall list is not empty
    a. pick a random wall in the wall list
    b. if either of the cells which are divided by the wall are unvisited (either depends on which side its approached from)
     make the wall a passage and mark the next cell as visited and add its walls to the list
    c. check how many cells have been visited around a wall (Cannot be more than 2)
    d. remove the wall from the wall list


Simplified Version:
1. Instead of keeping track of how many neighbors have been visited, just randomly visit cells that neighbor an already visited cell
2. This will lead to more branching
